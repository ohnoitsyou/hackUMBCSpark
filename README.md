hackUMBCSpark
=============

Code for the Spark Core project I started at hackUMBC

I'm slowly working to add new features to the spark.
I've got some serious plans for this project long term.

I'll be creating a writeup for this on my blog.

If you have a core and want to get this to work, all you'll need
to do is add your access token to the lights.js file,
run npm install and you're good to go.

If you find bugs, please report them.
If you develop a newfeature, please file a pull request.
